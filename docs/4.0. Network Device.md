# AMWA NMOS Network Control API Specification: Network Device

_(c) AMWA 2017, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

The Network Device API route permits the broadcast controller to get the network device information which allows it to map the network topology into its user interface.

The response to a GET request includes, at a minimum, a unique identifier for further reference, its chassis ID (same as reported via LLDP), its management IP, the global (switch-wide) MTU, and an array of interfaces. The interfaces information includes port id (same as transmitted through LLDP), speed, admin and operation status. The MTU is optional and can be included if different from the global MTU.

Only a GET operation is permitted on a Network Device.
