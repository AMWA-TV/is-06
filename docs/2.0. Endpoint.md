### Endpoint 

The Network will gather the following information about an endpoint.  They are:
* the MAC address of the endpoint 
* the IP address that is used to send or receive a flow 
* the switch ID and finally
* the Ethernet Interface to which the endpoint is connected.

The endpoint is required to do ARP and/or LLDP so the network can learn all the above information.  This is escepially critical when static IP addresses are used.
