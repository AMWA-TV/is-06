## Conforming to Schemas

When interacting with a Network Control API, a client may assume responses from the API conform to the specified JSON schemas.

## Failure Modes

If a client receives an HTTP 500 response code from the API a failure has occurred. The client should display the content of the response's `error` field to the user if possible, and indicate that the Network Controller may be in a bad state.
