# Data Model: Network Device

_(c) AMWA 2017, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

The Network Device (switch) information provided in this data model permits the broadcast controller to map the network topology into its user interface.

The parameters of a Network Device are:

* `id`: uniquely identifies a network device
* `chassis_id`: its chassis ID (same as reported via LLDP)
* `mgmt_ip`: its management IP address
* `mtu`: the global (switch-wide) MTU
* `interfaces`: an array of interfaces

The interfaces information includes port id (same as transmitted through LLDP), speed, admin and operation status. The interface MTU is optional and can be included if different from the global MTU.

Only a GET operation is permitted on a Network Device.
