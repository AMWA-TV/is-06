# Data Model: Network Address Translation

_(c) AMWA 2017, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

A Network Address Translation policy represents a simple NAT policy for IP Addresses and/or Ports, to be applied by the network controller to the appropriate [Network Devices](3.3.%20Data%20Model%20-%20Network%20Device.md).

The parameters of a Network Address Translation policy are:

* `id`: uniquely identifies a network address translation policy
* `label`: an optional human-readable name for the policy
* `match`: optionally, one or more of the `source_ip`, `source_port`, `destination_ip`, `destination_port` values that must be matched for the policy to be applied
* `translated`: one or more of the `source_ip`, `source_port`, `destination_ip`, `destination_port` values that will be applied if the `match` conditions are met
* `receiver_endpoint_ids`: the receiver endpoints for which the policy should be applied (or any receiver if the array is empty)

The operations that are permitted on a Network Address Translation policy are GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

When a network controller does not support the network address translation functionality, the response to all operations must be 501 Not Implemented.
