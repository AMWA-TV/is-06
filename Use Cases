Phase 1 Of Network Control API
Use Cases

1. As an user, I need one way for the network controller to communicate to a management system what devices are connected to the switch, what network links are available for use, and how the switch fits into the network topology.  So that I do not have to spend large amounts of time building and configuring network equipment.
2. As an Installer and Operator, I want to discover the Network Topology to verify the Network Switches and Nodes that has been installed so that I can present the information meaningfully to users and to ensure that it matches the original design.
3. As an Operator, I would like to discover the capacity of the ports and links between two Nodes so there is sufficient capacity for my applications.
4. As a Designer, I would like to calculate the total capacity of the Network so that I can optimize my network and plan upgrades effectively
5. As an Engineer, I want to modify the administrative state of my port and links in the Network Topology so that I can plan what capacity is available for my applications and keep the infrastructure secure
6. As an Operator, I want to automatically discover the operational ports and links in the Network Topology so I can make the best use of my network resources and not create any unnecessary expense
7. As an Operator, I want to determine reachability and bandwidth limitations between operational ports in the Network Topology so that I can support low and high bitrate services and non-blocking network architectures
