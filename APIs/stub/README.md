# **[Work In Progress]** AMWA Network Control Specification

The stub provides a sample implementation of the APIs that have been  described in this repository. It uses the files present in the sampledata folder for data simulation.    
The subscription API is yet to be implemented. 

## Usage:

* ./nc-sim -ip:port=<IPADDRESS>:<PORTNO> -dir=<DIRECTORY IP CONTAINING THE FILES PERTAINING TO THE SIMULATED DATA>
* Eg ./ne-sim-osx -ip:port=192.168.1.1:8282 -dir=./sampledata

## Supported Platforms
The stub has been tested on the following platforms
* macOS Sierra (10.12.3)
* CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503
* Windows 7
