      These routines enable applications to learn about the topology managed by the network controller. The BC can get the topology at any time and can also register to receive the updates from the network.  The topology consists of network devices, its interfaces, links between devices and endpoints.    While the network devices are discovered, the endpoints information is received by the NC  through the PMN API. This is primarily because the vast majority of endpoints at this current time do not support any discovery protocol such as LLDP.
