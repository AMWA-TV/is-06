# AMWA Network Control Specification

This repository contains details of this AMWA Specification for Network Control API.  The Network Control API is the interface between the NMOS Services and the Network Controller to secure Network Services.Â  Specifically it is the Northbound API from the Network Controller to the NMOS services. It is defined in the JTMN Architecture document in the Network Layer. 

The main areas of work are:
1. Discovery of Network Topology and Discovery of endpoint devices that are connected to the Network Switches
2. Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete Network Streams (Flow Management) 
3. Monitoring and Diagnostics

This github is covering 1. above.
