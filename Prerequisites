Prerequisite
1. The Network Control API is expecting that  ARP, LLDP and/or DHCP is supported by the Network and host devices  (nodes, senders and receivers). The Network should at a minimum have the IP address and the MAC address of the device on the other side of its interface.  The device connected to the network should have the same information so it can inform its servers, RDS in particular. While ARP provides the mapping of IP address and MAC address, the use of LLDP provides a way of exchanging much more such as information relating to system, port, VLAN etc.  Hence, support of LLDP is recommended for all host devices and network.
